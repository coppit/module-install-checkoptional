Module::Install::CheckOptional

A Module::Install extension that checks to see if an optional dependency is
satisfied


MODULE DEPENDENCIES

To use this module, you will need to install:

- Module::Install

To test this module, you will need to install:

- IO::CaptureOutput
- Test::More


INSTALLATION

To install this package, change to the directory where you unarchived this
distribution and type the following:

  perl Makefile.PL
  make
  make test
  make install

You can install this package into a non-default location by appending one of
the following to the "perl Makefile.PL" command:

- "PREFIX=/installation/path" (for installation into a custom location),
- "INSTALLDIRS=site" (for installation into site-specific Perl directories)
- "INSTALLDIRS=perl" (for installation into standard Perl directories).

If you make the installation into your own directory, then remember that you
must tell perl where to search for modules before trying to 'use' them. For
example:

  use lib '/home/userid/lib';
  use ext::Module::Install;
  ...
  check_optional();


INSTALLATION PROBLEMS

If "make test" fails, run

  make test TEST_VERBOSE=1

and see which test(s) are failing. Please email the results to the address

section REPORTING BUGS below.
